# kmerz
kmerz is a very simple de Bruijn graph denovo assembly program written in C++ with associated tools in Python. kmerz is not a practical tool to assemble a genome but rather a simple demonstration program to illustrate how de Bruijn graph assembly works and to provide a context for developing other simple demonstration tools for training purposes.
