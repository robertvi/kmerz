# kmerz
kmerz is a very simple de Bruijn graph denovo assembly program written in C++ with associated tools in Python. kmerz is not a practical tool to assemble a genome but rather a simple demonstration program to illustrate how de Bruijn graph assembly works and to provide a context for developing other simple demonstration tools for training purposes.

# What is kmerz?
kmerz is a currently able to assemble simulated reads from simple randomly generated DNA sequences back into contigs. The scripts folder contains Python tools to generate random "genome" sequences, simulated reads and for counting kmers in the reads.
